# Omer Bensaadon's Personal User Manual
Hello! If you're reading this, we probably work together.

This repo was created to publicly store my Personal User Manual (PUM), see [this article](https://betterprogramming.pub/personal-user-manuals-the-good-the-bad-and-the-template-7b80db5044ea) for more information on PUMs. The questions below are ones I've scraped together from a few different examples, but feel free to use them for your own PUM.

**PS: If we work together and you have a personal user manual, I'd love to read it!**

## About Me
**My name is Omer Bensaadon and I am a Product Manager.**

As a human, I am an Israeli immigrant who spent most of their formative years in South Florida before heading to the University of Alabama where (fun fact) I graduated 1 credit short of a Cryptocurrency Minor.

In my career, I started off in the Civic/Gov Tech space as a Civic Digital Fellow and Pivotal Labs employee working with agencies like the Census Bureau, the Air Force, and the intelligence community.

I have moved into more and more technical domains in recent years (namely, OSS infrastructure). Most recently, I wrote the [Knative Getting Started Guide](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/), played a part in giving the Knative site a much needed facelift and helped manage VMware's investment in Knative as part of my work there.

I am interested in coffee, climbing, economics/politics, history, web3, and interior design.

## Working with Me
**🌎 Timezone:** EST (Brooklyn, NY)

**🕐 Working Hours:** Usually 8AM-3PM + 7PM-9PM (I usually climb in the afternoons when I'm not injured 🤕)

**🗣 Textual Communication Style:** funny, direct, short bursty messages

**🤌 I prefer to receive feedback...** quickly, directly, written or verbal! I find the "Situation-Behavior-Impact" format to work well for me.

#### My preferred ways to be contacted are...
1. **For a quick question,** feel free to DM me on Slack! If I have a status to the effect of "Deep Work" please schedule your message for a later time unless it is rather urgent.
2. **For a longer discussion,** I would prefer to to spend 30 minutes chatting on Zoom or collaborating on a doc than Slacking back and forth for an hour. If you need my opinion on something where I need a lot of context, some reading material (if it exists) beforehand would be much appreciated!
3. **For feedback,** feel free to Slack me, start a Zoom meeting, email me, whatever! I love receiving feedback (positive and constructive).

### I do my best work when...
* 🤩 My enthusiasm is met with enthusiasm
* I am talking to end-users and shipping software on a regular basis
* I am talking to my teammates regularly
* I have time and space to do "deep work"
* 💖 I feel a high degree of psychological safety and my coworkers are giving me lots of feedback!
* 🤝 I am trusted by default and have the ability to make bets that may not bear fruit right away
* I have a clear understanding of what the "big picture" end goal is and am given the opportunity to chart the path from there
* I feel supported by the organization with help from user research, engineering, design and leadership
* 👨🏻‍🚒 I feel my team feels comfortable enough around me to roast me

### I become de-motivated when...
* I am not talking to end-users and am not shipping software on a regular basis.
* Leadership is too "hands-on" and does not trust me to deliver (i.e. helicopter leadership)
* I have a mountain of user research to parse through all by myself
* I am being pushed to finish something by a specific date (i.e. death march)
* I am treated like a "JIRA-Jockey" lots of documenting for leadership, not a lot of new learnings from users
* I feel like I am no longer learning and am on "auto-pilot"

### You know I am struggling/stressed when...
* 😿 I am not my usual smiley, chipper self in meetings!
* 😵‍💫 I start being checked out from meetings or generally seem distracted.
* I start being short with you over Slack 

### I am currently trying to improve and would appreciate feedback on...
* ✍️ My long-form writing ability, striking a balance between conciseness and accuracy
* My ability to delegate work effectively (I tend to take on too much)
* 🧮 Being able to effectively digest product data and communicate insights to the team
* 👂 Active listening and becoming an empathetic leader
* 🤠 I am trying to grow into a people manager, so any feedback related to that would be awesome.

# Omer Bensaadon's Personal User Manual

**My name is Omer Bensaadon and I am a Product Manager.**

As a human, I am an Israeli immigrant who spent most of their formative years in South Florida before heading to the University of Alabama where (fun fact) I graduated 1 credit short of a Cryptocurrency Minor.

In my career, I started off in the Civic/Gov Tech space as a Civic Digital Fellow and Pivotal Labs employee working with agencies like the Census Bureau, the Air Force, and the intelligence community.

I have moved into more and more technical domains in recent years (namely, OSS infrastructure). Most recently, I wrote the [Knative Getting Started Guide](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/), played a part in giving the Knative site a much needed facelift and helped manage VMware's investment in Knative as part of my work there.

I am could talk your ear off about coffee, climbing, economics, history, cryptography, and interior design.

* 🧠 I have time and space to do "deep work" on product strategy and research

* 🧑‍💻 ENGs are talking to me about ways we could be increasing velocity by addressing cruft
* 👨🏻‍🚒 I feel my team feels comfortable enough around me to roast me

## Working with Me: Logistics
**🌎 Timezone:** EST (Brooklyn, NY)

**🕐 Working Hours:** Usually 8AM-5PM (sometimes I climb in the afternoons 🧗🏼 so I'll be on later in the evening 🌚

**🗣 One thing you should know about my communication style...:**
- I try not to treat Slack like constant-communication and am always "inactive," this creates a barrier-to-entry for messages that I very much appreciate (so I can focus). This cuts both ways, if I message you, I am not expecting a response from you right away.

**🤌 I prefer to receive feedback...** I love receiving feedback, seriously! Please toss me any feedback constructive, positive, or otherwise anytime
<details>
<summary>Have tough feedback to give me and want a format I like? </summary>
I find the "Situation-Behavior-Impact-Result" format to work well for me.

When {SITUATION} happened you reacted by {BEHAVIOR} and that had {IMPACT} which created {NEGATIVE RESULT}.

</details>

#### My preferred ways to be contacted are...
1. **For a quick question,** feel free to DM me on Slack! If I have a status to the effect of "Deep Work" please schedule your message for a later time unless it is rather urgent.
2. **For a longer discussion,** I would prefer to to spend 30 minutes chatting on Zoom or collaborating on a doc than Slacking back and forth for an hour. If you need my async opinion on something where I need a lot of context, some reading material (if it exists) beforehand would be much appreciated!
3. **For feedback,** feel free to Slack me, start a Zoom meeting, email me, whatever! I love receiving feedback (constructive especially).

**PS: If we work together and you have a personal user manual, I'd love to read it!**
**PPS: If you've made it this far and want help creating your own, I'll volunteer to help you put it together)**

## My name is Omer Bensaadon and I am a Product Manager.

I am an Israeli immigrant who spent most of their formative years in South Florida before heading to the University of Alabama where (fun fact) I graduated 1 credit short of a self-designed Cryptocurrency Minor.

In my career, I started off in the Civic/Gov Tech space as a Civic Digital Fellow and Pivotal Labs employee working with agencies like the Census Bureau, the Air Force, and the intelligence community.

I have moved into more and more technical domains in recent years (namely, OSS infrastructure). Most recently, I wrote the [Knative Getting Started Guide](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/), played a part in giving the Knative site a much needed facelift and helped manage VMware's investment in Knative as part of my work there.

🗣 I could talk your ear off about coffee, climbing, economics, history, cryptography, and interior design.

## Working with Me: Logistics
**🌎 Timezone:** EST (Brooklyn, NY)

**🕐 Working Hours:** Usually 8AM-5PM (sometimes I climb in the afternoons 🧗🏼 so I'll be on later in the evening 🌚

**📞  One thing you should know about my communication style...:**
- I try not to treat Slack like constant-communication and am always "inactive," this creates a barrier-to-entry for messages that I very much appreciate (so I can focus). This cuts both ways, if I message you, I am not expecting a response from you right away.
- For a longer discussion, I would prefer to spend 30 minutes jamming on Zoom/Google Docs to Slacking back and forth for an hour.

**💬  I love receiving feedback, seriously!** Please toss me any feedback (constructive or positive) anytime in any format.
